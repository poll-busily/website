I'm a software and cybersecurity consultant based in Cambridge, UK. In my career I've worked in deeply-embedded software, at the boundary of hardware and software, and all the way up in the cloud, writing distributed services.

My personal interests are in photography (especially landscapes and wildlife), hiking, long-distance cycling, amateur radio and some real niche areas like fountain pens and calligraphy, motorcycle restoration, and hi-fi headphones.
